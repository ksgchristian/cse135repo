## 📊 Third-Party Analytics (Free Choice)

**Tool Used:** Simple Analytics  

**Why this tool:**  
Simple Analytics was chosen for its strong focus on privacy. It does not use cookies, does not track personal data, and is GDPR-compliant by default. This makes it a good alternative to traditional analytics tools while still providing useful insights such as page views and traffic sources without compromising user privacy.

**Analysis:**  
Compared to more invasive analytics platforms, Simple Analytics prioritizes ethical data collection. It is easy to set up, lightweight, and aligns well with privacy-conscious web development practices while still giving meaningful usage metrics.
